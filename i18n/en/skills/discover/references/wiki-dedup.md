# /discover wiki dedup

`tools/discover.py` deduplicates candidates against the existing wiki when `--wiki-root wiki` is passed. This document explains what the dedup does and does not catch, so the user-facing report is accurate.

## What it catches

For each candidate, `tools/discover.py` extracts the `arxiv_id` from the candidate record (S2's `externalIds.ArXiv`, DeepXiv's `arxiv_id`, etc.) and checks whether any existing `wiki/papers/*.md` page has a matching `arxiv` (or legacy `arxiv_id`) in its frontmatter. Matches are dropped from the shortlist before scoring; the count is reported as `wiki_dedup_count`.

This catches the typical case: an already-ingested paper bubbles up as a recommendation again. Surfacing such a paper would waste the user's review attention; dropping it is correct.

## What it does not catch

- **Title-only matches**: a paper in the wiki without `arxiv` or `arxiv_id` (e.g., a journal article ingested via `/edit`) will not match a candidate by title alone. This is intentional — fuzzy title matching produces false positives that hide legitimate candidates.
- **arXiv version skew**: `2106.09685` and `2106.09685v3` should both be treated as the same paper. The frontmatter scanner strips `arxiv:`/`ARXIV:` prefixes but does not currently strip `vN` suffixes. If you find duplicates leaking through, normalise the version suffix in the candidate's `arxiv_id` before comparison.
- **Cross-source duplicates within the candidate set**: the dedup pass before wiki filtering uses `_candidate_key` (arxiv → S2 paperId → title-slug) which catches most cross-source duplicates from S2 and DeepXiv. Fully missing IDs and titles are dropped silently.

## What to do with a "high dedup" report

If `wiki_dedup_count` is high relative to `candidates_total` (e.g., 30 / 50), the wiki is already well-covered for these anchors. Two interpretations:

1. The user is looking for breadth and should switch to a different seed (different anchor, broader topic, or `--from-wiki` to explore adjacent papers).
2. The recommendation channel is genuinely saturated — there is little new to recommend in this neighborhood.

The skill should mention high dedup in the user-facing report; do not hide it.

## What dedup does not do

`/discover` never modifies the wiki to "fix" a duplicate. If the candidate's metadata seems richer than what is currently in the wiki, that is a `/edit` or `/check` concern, not a `/discover` concern.
